# Power-Outage-Risks-Analysis
This project investigates the severity of major power outages in the continental United States using a rich dataset that combines outage event data with regional, climatic, economic, and utility-related features. The goal is to understand what factors contribute to more severe outages—defined in terms of duration, customers affected, and demand loss—and to build a predictive model that estimates the expected duration of future outages.

Through exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and permutation-based methods, the project identifies key risk factors associated with outage severity, including climate region, seasonal timing, and cause category. Special attention is given to the role of weather anomalies (e.g., El Niño) and urbanization in shaping the impact of grid failures.

In the final phase, a regression model is developed to predict outage duration based on interpretable variables, demonstrating how data science can be applied to support utility planning, disaster response, and infrastructure resilience.
